# Idle game about paying rent

## Gameplay

1. All rents increase exponentially from game start
2. All property prices increase exponentially from game start

You will always be renting your main home which has its rent rise exponentially forever, providing a constant expense in the game. If you miss a single rent payment you lose. You start out with no properties and must take out a home loan in order to purchase your first. You can take out as many loans as you want, of any size, but if you miss two payments in a row you lose.

You can choose to buy properties and rent them out, but the prices of these properties will rise from the beginning of the game. If you don't buy early you may never afford property. You can hire a property manager or manage rents yourself for potentially higher gains

Periodic recessions or construction booms have an impact on both supply and demand, thereby affecting rental income. Maintenance is a reoccurring cost that properties will generate. You have a reputation, and if you fail to provide maintenance for your properties, people will be less willing to rent from you, resulting in lower rental rates.
